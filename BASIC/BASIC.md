## BASIC version of Nashlib

This version of the Compact Numerical Methods codes was the "first", except
it was really a family of methods built for the Data General Nova, the Data
General Eclipse, the Hewlett-Packard 9830A, the Tektronix 4051 and 
North Star Horizon computers among others. (Some codes were built for a
variety of other machines such as the DEC PDP-10, some programmable calculators,
and others.) That the code is still functioning is a surprise and possibly
a marvel. 

The present collection is being tested under bwbasic on Linux Mint 20.1.
However, it likely will "work" (or "work" with minor modification) on a
number of other BASIC interpreters and compilers.
