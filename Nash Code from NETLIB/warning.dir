WARNING.DIR

The usual formatting of flexible (floppy) disks does NOT
provide enough directory entries for the number of files
in the Compact Numerical Methods collection. The files
are therefore stored in a subdirectory, since subdirectories
are not as limited in the number of entries they may contain.
