The 1989 Turbo Pascal 5 code is at https://netlib.org/pascal/cnm.tgz

## Notes

A very large portion of the code in the 1989 collection is directed to handling issues related to the
MS DOS operating system of IBM-like PC computers of the time. Much of this "infrastructure" will be
removed in the 2021 Pascal code for the Free Pascal compiler.
