# Nashlib 2021 Pascal version

Much of the code in the Turbo Pascal version from **netlib** is directed to managing the awkwardness of the MS DOS operating system. I (JN) am appalled at the complexity of the "infrastructure" compared to the underlying numerical methods. Therefore this version of the Pascal code, running under the Free Pascal Compiler, has been stripped of much of the detail and generality of the original. The focus is now on the numerical methods with rather minimal wrapping to allow for examples rather than a general package.
