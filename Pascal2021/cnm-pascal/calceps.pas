function calceps:real;
{calceps.pas ==
  This function returns the machine EPSILON or floating point tolerance,
  the smallest positive real number such that 1.0 + EPSILON > 1.0.
  EPSILON is needed to set various tolerances for different algorithms.
  While it could be entered as a constant, I prefer to calculate it, since
  users tend to move software between machines without paying attention to
  the computing environment. Note that more complete routines exist.
