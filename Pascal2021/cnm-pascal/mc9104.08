Diskettes received. Unfortunately, there is a difference between
the file I have and that on the diskettes. It is just 1 character
in two copies of the file ERRATA.CNM. The last non-blank line now
reads

     DR23A      -- file to allow for batch testing of LOGISTIC.PAS

instead of 

     DR23AX     -- file to allow for batch testing of LOGISTIC.PAS

i.e. an X has become a space. 

The file goes in the root directory and the \CNM directory of the
distribution disk (two copies are included, since I wanted to make
sure the errata are available immediately).

I don't think the error is a disaster; it can be fixed very easily 
with any text editor. I understand you use SLED, which will do this
fix straightforwardly. If WP is used, the file must be loaded and
saved via CTRL-F5 (DOS text operations).

Where the error arose is an interesting question. My current copy
of the file is dated 1 day later than that on the diskettes, so
the fault is likely mine, though I have no idea how it came about.

The correct file is listed below between the ===== boundaries.

Let me know that this has been received. By the way, it is no
tragedy if the disks are NOT updated. The important material is
all there, and users should be able to figure things out pretty
quickly.

Algorithm 23.

There is an error in Algorithm 23, page 214.

The 3rd line from the bottom of the page reads

          until notcomp or (i>=n);

It SHOULD read
  
          until notcomp or (i>=m);

That is, we wish to compare i to m, NOT n.

While not an error, the occasion of this repair has been used to
allow for the saving of residuals in nonlinear least squares
problems.  This requires some minor modifications to the calling
sequences for the function NLRES and procedure NLJAC which are to be
part of problem files such as ROSEN.PAS or JJACF.PAS and the new
problem file LOGISTIC.PAS.

Wherever function NLRES is called, using a statement such as

       res:=nlres(i, n, Bvec, notcomp);

the call should be in the form

       res:=nlres(i, n, Bvec, notcomp, Workdata);

Similarly, wherever procedure NLJAC is called, using a statement like

          nljac(i, n, Bvec, X);

the call should be in the form

          nljac(i, n, Bvec, X, Workdata);


Consequent alterations to the program files:

     ALG23.PAS  -- changed to reflect correction of the error and
                   addition of Workdata to the calling sequence of
                   NLRES (3 places) and NLJAC (1 place)

     DR23.PAS   -- modified to note that there is an alternative
                   test problem LOGISTIC.PAS. The file must be 
                   edited to "include" LOGISTIC.PAS instead of
                   ROSEN.PAS.
     
     ROSEN.PAS  -- modified to include Workdata in the defining 
                   statement for NLRES and NLJAC. Workdata is also
                   altered to be VARiable in FMINFN and FMINGR to
                   allow working information to be saved in this
                   data structure. Workdata is defined to be of
                   type probdata, defined in file CONSTYPE.DEF.

     JJACF.PAS  -- modified to include Workdata in the defining 
                   statement for NLRES and NLJAC. Workdata is also
                   altered to be VARiable in FMINFN and FMINGR to
                   allow working information to be saved in this
                   data structure.

New problem file
   
     LOGISTIC.PAS -- a problem file to allow the nonlinear least
                   squares fit of data to a 3 parameter logistic
                   growth curve.

New data files

     EX23A.CNM  -- file to provide the Hobbs data (page 145 CNM2)
                   for LOGISTIC.PAS

     DR23AX     -- file to allow for batch testing of LOGISTIC.PAS
