# Nash-Compact-Numerics

Thie ia a project to convert the Pacal Routines in John Nash's book "Compact Numerical Methods for Computers: Linear Algebra and FUnction Minimization" into Python

Our goal is to provide a good set of numerical methods in Python source for people who can't use NumPy or SciPy because there's no libraries for their platform, their platform is too small, or because the work in an environment where binary libraries can't be imported.

We plan to do this in two stages.  First we plan to translate the code from Pascal into Python so that the interfaces conform as closesly as possible the original Pascal so that users can refer to Professor Nash's original text.  Second we plan to bring the interfases as close as possible to those of NumPy and SciPy.

Note: The original Pascal code is not ready to use.  It was written to run under TurboPascal running on DOS and has not been modified to run on more modern system.
